# Logistic Regression and Feature Importance
## Predicting Employee Attrition Across Factors Affecting Workplace Behavior and Satisfaction
Logistic regression model and feature importance on employee attrition data, with presentation.

Employee attrition is when an organization loses an employee and has an outstanding position to fill as a result; therefore, an increased attrition rate indicates that the organization is experiencing a decrease in its labor force, which impacts operations by decreasing productivity and employee morale. 
From an organization’s standpoint, the most influential queries regarding employee attrition become the likelihood that an employee will leave, and what factors are influential in determining whether an employee leaves the organization.
